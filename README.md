# ImageClassifier
Developing an Image Classifier with Deep Learning

Application that can train an image sorter on a dataset and then predict new images using the trained model.
This application was built using deep learning with neural networks to receive flower images and return the most likely species.

Then the project was converted to script files so that it could be run from the command line, allowing the user to change hyperparameters, save a checkpoint with classifier and neural network information, load the checkpoint so it don't have to retrain, and make predictions of chosen images.
